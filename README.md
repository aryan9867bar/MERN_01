Project Overview:-
This project is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The primary focus of the application is to implement secure and efficient user authentication and data management. It includes the following key features:
-- User Registration: Allows new users to create an account by providing essential details, which are securely stored in the database.
-- User Login: Enables registered users to log in to the application using their credentials. Authentication is handled securely to protect user data.
-- Contact Form: Provides users with the ability to submit contact information, which is then fetched and stored in the database for further processing or communication.

Features:-
-- Backend: Node.js with Express.js handles the server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
-- Frontend: React.js is used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
-- Database: MongoDB is utilized for storing user credentials, registration details, and contact form submissions.
-- Security: User data is protected using industry-standard encryption and authentication techniques.
-- Validation: Input fields in forms are validated to ensure data integrity and consistency.
